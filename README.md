# Masterball
Masterball helps Team Rocket members doing there jobs during p2p corrections

Use it as much as you want, but we are at 42 so .. be sure to understand and know how to reproduce these tests yourself. No scripty-kids here!

## Damn ! What is this awesoooooome program ? 
During p2p corrections - as a good student - we sometimes have to test files containing functions instead of programs.

Adding a library, configuring prototypes, recoding functions (such as ft_putchar) takes time! 
A good corrector must perform unit tests to be consistent before the test of the Moulinette, complicated when there are more than 25 exercises in one day..

Masterball is our TEAM - ROCKET M.A.G.I.C F.I.L.E which contains everything we need to test all your functions without wasting time.

## Utilisation 

Ahahahahah you are supposed to know how to use this small file without manual, open it, read it, use it like big!
