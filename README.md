# Masterball
Masterball is a collection of unit tests that helps Team Rocket members doing their job during p2p corrections.

Use it as much as you want, but this is 42 so... make sure you understand these tests and are able to reproduce them. No scripty-kids here!

⚠️ Run the update.sh script sometimes, just in case
⚠️ If you see errors just e-mail us at ldallend@student.42.fr

## Damn ! What is this awesoooooome program ?
During p2p corrections - as a good students - we sometimes have to test source code containing functions and/or programs.

Adding a library, configuring prototypes, re-coding functions (such as ft_putchar) takes time! 
A good corrector must perform unit tests in order to be consistent before the test of the Moulinette, which is complicated when say, there are more than 25 exercises in one day...

Masterball is our TEAM - ROCKET M.A.G.I.C T.O.O.L which contains everything we need to test all your functions in a timely manner.

## Compilation ?

Ahahahahah you are supposed to know how to use theses main.c files without a manual. Open it, read it, use it like BIG!
